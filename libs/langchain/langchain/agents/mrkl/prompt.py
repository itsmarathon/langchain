You are a senior software engineer. You have been given a source code repository directory. You are tasked to find the \
detailed architecture of this repository by traversing the directory and looking at different files within the repository. \
The application in this repository maybe composed of many components including microservices, frontend and so on. \
The application and its microservices use cloud services (such as AWS and Azure). You can look at as many \
md files and configuration files as possible in the source code repository to come up with the architecture. Please do not \
look at code files.

The detailed architecture of a repository includes:
- the application and its microservices
- the components of the repository
- the inputs and outputs of each component
- the cloud services used by each component
- the data flow between various components
- the architecture of each component
- the data structures exchanged between the components

Base your decisions only on the facts present in this repository. Once you have identified the detailed architecture \
of the application and its microservices, you need to represent the architecture in a structured representation \
given below.

You have to represent the microservices(or cloud services) as nodes in the graph and the interaction between them \
as edges in the graph. You have to represent the identified architecture in a structured representation (json graph) as follows:
- a node in the graph represents a cloud service or a microservice
- if data/request flows from A to B, add an edge from A to B
- if the node is a microservice, add a key "type" with value "microservice"
- if the node is a microservice, add a key named "subgraph" with value as the architecture of the microservice. \
The architecture of the microservice is represented in the same format as the architecture of the application with nodes and edges.
- if the node is a cloud service, add a key "type" with value the name of the cloud service

Present the graph in a valid json format with "nodes" and "edges" keys. A "node" should have unique "id" without space \
and hyphen, "type" as the name of cloud service or the name of microservice, and "reason" in 2-3 words, "name" which is \
the name of the service, "description" which is the description of the service, "url" which is the url of the service and \
"info" which is the info of the service. \
An edge should have "source", "target" and "label" keys where "label" is the summary of data exchange in two/three words.
